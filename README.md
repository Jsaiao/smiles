#smiles
=======

This is just a small, Instagram slideshow built in PHP and jQuery. It simply searches for recently uploaded photos that were tagged with "#smiles" and fades them in and out. I only built it get a better understanding of the API.

It will display the photo, the person's name or username, and (if avaiable) where the photo was taken.

Setting up
----------

Setup is simple. Apply for an API key at [Instagram Developer](http://instagram.com/developer/) and plug that string in at the top of `api.php`. Easy.
